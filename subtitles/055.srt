1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,780
taught the Quran,

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,860
created humanity,

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,740
˹and˺ taught them speech.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,020
The sun and the moon ˹travel˺ with precision.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,780
The stars and the trees bow down ˹in submission˺.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,040
As for the sky, He raised it ˹high˺, and set the balance ˹of justice˺

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,080
so that you do not defraud the scales.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,500
Weigh with justice, and do not give short measure.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,220
He laid out the earth for all beings.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,100
In it are fruit, palm trees with date stalks,

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,660
and grain with husks, and aromatic plants.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,840
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you ˹humans and jinn˺ both deny? 

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,520
He created humankind from ˹sounding˺ clay like pottery,

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:08,540
and created jinn from a ˹smokeless˺ flame of fire.

15
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,120
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,880
˹He is˺ Lord of the two easts and the two wests.

17
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,520
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,820
He merges the two bodies of ˹fresh and salt˺ water,

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,040
yet between them is a barrier they never cross.

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,740
Out of both ˹waters˺ come forth pearls and coral.

22
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,920
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,060
To Him belong the ships with raised sails, sailing through the seas like mountains.

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,000
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,960
Every being on earth is bound to perish.

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,200
Only your Lord Himself, full of Majesty and Honour, will remain ˹forever˺.

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,360
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

28
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,260
All those in the heavens and the earth are dependent on Him. Day in and day out He has something to bring about.

29
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,320
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
We will soon attend to you ˹for judgment˺, O  two multitudes ˹of jinn and humans˺!

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,180
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:50,500
O  assembly of jinn and humans! If you can penetrate beyond the realms of the heavens and the earth, then do so. ˹But˺ you cannot do that without ˹Our˺ authority.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,700
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:10,360
Flames of fire and ˹molten˺ copper will be sent against you, and you will not be able to defend one another.

35
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,180
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

36
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:28,900
˹How horrible will it be˺ when the heavens will split apart, becoming rose-red like ˹burnt˺ oil!

37
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,420
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,140
On that Day there will be no need for any human or jinn to be asked about their sins.

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,760
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

40
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:08,880
The wicked will be recognized by their appearance, then will be seized by ˹their˺ forelocks and feet.

41
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

42
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,600
˹They will be told,˺ “This is the Hell which the wicked denied.”

43
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,800
They will alternate between its flames and scalding water.

44
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny? 

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:41,360
And whoever is in awe of standing before their Lord will have two Gardens.

46
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,820
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

47
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,300
˹Both will be˺ with lush branches.

48
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,060
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

49
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,840
In each ˹Garden˺ will be two flowing springs.

50
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,980
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

51
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,600
In each will be two types of every fruit.

52
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,960
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

53
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:26,980
Those ˹believers˺ will recline on furnishings lined with rich brocade. And the fruit of both Gardens will hang within reach.

54
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,860
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

55
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:44,760
In both ˹Gardens˺ will be maidens of modest gaze, who no human or jinn has ever touched before.

56
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

57
00:05:52,100 --> 00:06:02,020
Those ˹maidens˺ will be ˹as elegant˺ as rubies and coral.

58
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,620
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

59
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,360
Is there any reward for goodness except goodness?

60
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,340
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

61
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,060
And below these two ˹Gardens˺ will be two others.

62
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,780
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

63
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,820
Both will be dark green.

64
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,060
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

65
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,840
In each will be two gushing springs.

66
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,460
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

67
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,240
In both will be fruit, palm trees, and pomegranates.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,500
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

69
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,260
In all Gardens will be noble, pleasant mates.

70
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,400
˹They will be˺ maidens with gorgeous eyes, reserved in pavilions.

71
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,620
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

72
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,900
No human or jinn has ever touched these ˹maidens˺ before.

73
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,820
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

74
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:43,380
All ˹believers˺ will be reclining on green cushions and splendid carpets.

75
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:51,720
Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?

76
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:01,060
Blessed is the Name of your Lord, full of Majesty and Honour.
