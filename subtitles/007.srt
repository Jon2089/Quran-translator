1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:23,380
˹This is˺ a Book sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺—do not let anxiety into your heart regarding it—so with it you may warn ˹the disbelievers˺, and as a reminder to the believers.

2
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:47,840
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not take others as guardians besides Him. How seldom are you mindful!

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:59,680
˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed! Our torment took them by surprise ˹while sleeping˺ at night or midday.

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:11,480
Their only cry—when overwhelmed by Our torment—was, “We have indeed been wrongdoers.”

5
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,460
We will surely question those who received messengers and We will question the messengers ˹themselves˺.

6
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:28,300
Then We will give them a full account with sure knowledge—for We were never absent.

7
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:41,120
The weighing on that Day will be just. As for those whose scale will be heavy ˹with good deeds˺, ˹only˺ they will be successful.

8
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:57,600
But those whose scale is light, they have doomed themselves for wrongfully denying Our signs.

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:07,540
We have indeed established you on earth and provided you with a means of livelihood. ˹Yet˺ you seldom give any thanks.

10
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:27,880
Surely We created you, then shaped you, then said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who refused to prostrate with the others.

11
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:40,560
Allah asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.”

12
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:51,840
Allah said, “Then get down from Paradise! It is not for you to be arrogant here. So get out! You are truly one of the disgraced.”

13
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,420
He appealed, “Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.”

14
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,360
Allah said, “You are delayed ˹until the appointed Day˺.”

15
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:09,020
He said, “For leaving me to stray I will lie in ambush for them on Your Straight Path.

16
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:31,360
I will approach them from their front, their back, their right, their left, and then You will find most of them ungrateful.”

17
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:44,680
Allah said, “Get out of Paradise! You are disgraced and rejected! I will certainly fill up Hell with you and your followers all together.”

18
00:03:44,680 --> 00:04:01,920
˹Allah said,˺ “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat from wherever you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.”

19
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:22,700
Then Satan tempted them in order to expose what was hidden of their nakedness. He said, “Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.”

20
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,960
And he swore to them, “I am truly your sincere advisor.”

21
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:59,740
So he brought about their fall through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. Then their Lord called out to them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and ˹did I not˺ tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?”

22
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:11,740
They replied, “Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be losers.”

23
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:30,300
Allah said, “Descend as enemies to each other. You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.”

24
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:43,440
He added, “There you will live, there you will die, and from there you will be resurrected.”

25
00:05:43,440 --> 00:06:01,460
O children of Adam! We have provided for you clothing to cover your nakedness and as an adornment. However, the best clothing is righteousness. This is one of Allah’s bounties, so perhaps you will be mindful.

26
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:29,440
O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your parents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to expose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who disbelieve.

27
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:50,320
Whenever they commit a shameful deed, they say, “We found our forefathers doing it and Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “No! Allah never commands what is shameful. How can you attribute to Allah what you do not know?”

28
00:06:50,320 --> 00:07:05,180
Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord has commanded uprightness and dedication ˹to Him alone˺ in worship, calling upon Him with sincere devotion. Just as He first brought you into being, you will be brought to life again.”

29
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:28,900
He has guided some, while others are destined to stray. They have taken devils as their masters instead of Allah—thinking they are ˹rightly˺ guided.

30
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:44,140
O Children of Adam! Dress properly whenever you are at worship. Eat and drink, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful.

31
00:07:44,140 --> 00:08:05,120
Ask, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions Allah has brought forth for His servants?” Say, “They are for the enjoyment of the believers in this worldly life, but they will be exclusively theirs on the Day of Judgment. This is how We make Our revelations clear for people of knowledge.”

32
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:31,820
Say, “My Lord has only forbidden open and secret indecencies, sinfulness, unjust aggression, associating ˹others˺ with Allah ˹in worship˺—a practice He has never authorized—and attributing to Allah what you do not know.”

33
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:45,840
For each community there is an appointed term. When their time arrives, they can neither delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it.

34
00:08:45,840 --> 00:09:28,260
O children of Adam! When messengers from among yourselves come to you reciting My revelations—whoever shuns evil and mends their ways, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.

35
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:40,880
But those who receive Our revelations with denial and arrogance will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.

36
00:09:40,880 --> 00:10:17,360
Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or deny His revelations? They will receive what is destined for them, until Our messenger-angels arrive to take their souls, asking them, “Where are those ˹false gods˺ you used to invoke besides Allah?” They will cry, “They have failed us,” and they will confess against themselves that they were indeed disbelievers.

37
00:10:19,720 --> 00:11:03,080
Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with the ˹evil˺ groups of jinn and humans that preceded you.” Whenever a group enters Hell, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord! They have misled us, so multiply their torment in the Fire.” He will answer, “It has already been multiplied for all, but you do not know.”

38
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:19,860
Then the leaders will say to their followers, “You were no better than us! So taste the torment for what you used to commit.”

39
00:11:19,860 --> 00:12:04,120
Surely those who receive our revelations with denial and arrogance, the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a needle. This is how We reward the wicked.

40
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:21,720
Hell will be their bed; flames will be their cover. This is how We reward the wrongdoers.

41
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:39,780
As for those who believe and do good—We never require of any soul more than what it can afford—it is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.

42
00:12:39,780 --> 00:13:37,560
We will remove whatever bitterness they had in their hearts. Rivers will flow under their feet. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah for guiding us to this. We would have never been guided if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had certainly come with the truth.” It will be announced to them, “This is Paradise awarded to you for what you used to do.”

43
00:13:39,820 --> 00:14:16,600
The residents of Paradise will call out to the residents of the Fire, “We have certainly found our Lord’s promise to be true. Have you too found your Lord’s promise to be true?” They will reply, “Yes, we have!” Then a caller will announce to both, “May Allah’s condemnation be upon the wrongdoers,

44
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:29,300
those who hindered ˹others˺ from Allah’s Way, strived to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, and disbelieved in the Hereafter.”

45
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:45,820
There will be a barrier between Paradise and Hell. And on the heights ˹of that barrier˺ will be people who will recognize ˹the residents of˺ both by their appearance. They will call out to the residents of Paradise, “Peace be upon you!” They will have not yet entered Paradise, but eagerly hope to.

46
00:14:48,200 --> 00:15:02,440
When their eyes will turn towards the residents of Hell, they will pray, “Our Lord! Do not join us with the wrongdoing people.”

47
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:38,520
Those on the heights will call out to some ˹tyrants in the Fire˺, who they will recognize by their appearance, saying, “Your large numbers and arrogance are of no use ˹today˺!

48
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:57,500
Are these ˹humble believers˺ the ones you swore would never be shown Allah’s mercy?” ˹Finally, those on the heights will be told:˺ “Enter Paradise! There will be no fear for you, nor will you grieve.”

49
00:16:00,800 --> 00:17:08,700
The residents of the Fire will then cry out to the residents of Paradise, “Aid us with some water or any provision Allah has granted you.” They will reply, “Allah has forbidden both to the disbelievers,

50
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:38,220
those who took this faith ˹of Islam˺ as mere amusement and play and were deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life.” ˹Allah will say,˺ “Today We will ignore them just as they ignored the coming of this Day of theirs and for rejecting Our revelations.”

51
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:49,980
We have certainly brought them a Book which We explained with knowledge—a guide and mercy for those who believe.

52
00:17:49,980 --> 00:18:44,820
Do they only await the fulfilment ˹of its warning˺? The Day it will be fulfilled, those who ignored it before will say, “The messengers of our Lord certainly came with the truth. Are there any intercessors who can plead on our behalf? Or can we be sent back so we may do ˹good,˺ unlike what we used to do?” They will have certainly ruined themselves, and whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.

53
00:18:44,820 --> 00:19:14,280
Indeed your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne. He makes the day and night overlap in rapid succession. He created the sun, the moon, and the stars—all subjected by His command. The creation and the command belong to Him ˹alone˺. Blessed is Allah—Lord of all worlds!

54
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,880
Call upon your Lord humbly and secretly. Surely He does not like the transgressors.

55
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:39,740
Do not spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. And call upon Him with hope and fear. Indeed, Allah’s mercy is always close to the good-doers.

56
00:19:39,740 --> 00:20:08,220
He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy. When they bear heavy clouds, We drive them to a lifeless land and then cause rain to fall, producing every type of fruit. Similarly, We will bring the dead to life, so perhaps you will be mindful.

57
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:21,860
The fertile land produces abundantly by the Will of its Lord, whereas the infertile land hardly produces anything. This is how We vary ˹Our˺ lessons to those who are thankful.

58
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:35,800
Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. I truly fear for you the torment of a tremendous Day.”

59
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:43,620
But the chiefs of his people said, “We surely see that you are clearly misguided.”

60
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:53,820
He replied, “O my people! I am not misguided! But I am a messenger from the Lord of all worlds,

61
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:04,680
conveying to you my Lord’s messages and giving you ˹sincere˺ advice. And I know from Allah what you do not know.

62
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:20,160
Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through one of your own, warning you, so you may beware and perhaps be shown mercy?”

63
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:38,540
But they rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned those who rejected Our signs. They were certainly a blind people.

64
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:50,220
And to the people of ’Âd We sent their brother Hûd. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. Will you not then fear Him?”

65
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:15,720
The disbelieving chiefs of his people responded, “We surely see you as a fool, and we certainly think you are a liar.”

66
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:23,240
Hûd replied, “O my people! I am no fool! But I am a messenger from the Lord of all worlds,

67
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,380
conveying to you my Lord’s messages. And I am your sincere advisor.

68
00:22:30,560 --> 00:23:03,240
Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through one of your own so he may warn you? Remember that He made you successors after the people of Noah and increased you greatly in stature. So remember Allah’s favours, so you may be successful.”

69
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:18,200
They said, “Have you come to us so that we would worship Allah alone and abandon what our forefathers used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true!”

70
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:49,240
He said, “You will certainly be subjected to your Lord’s torment and wrath. Do you dispute with me regarding the so-called gods which you and your forefathers have made up—a practice Allah has never authorized? Then wait! I too am waiting with you.”

71
00:23:49,240 --> 00:24:08,300
So We saved him and those with him by Our mercy and uprooted those who denied Our signs. They were not believers.

72
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:39,040
And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord: this is Allah’s she-camel as a sign to you. So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s land and do not harm her, or else you will be overcome by a painful punishment.

73
00:24:39,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Remember when He made you successors after ’Âd and established you in the land—˹and˺ you built palaces on its plains and carved homes into mountains. So remember Allah’s favours, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”

74
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:30,040
The arrogant chiefs of his people asked the lowly who believed among them, “Are you certain that Ṣâliḥ has been sent by his Lord?” They replied, “We certainly believe in what he has been sent with.”

75
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:37,660
The arrogant said, “We surely reject what you believe in.”

76
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:50,940
Then they killed the she-camel—defying their Lord’s command—and challenged ˹Ṣâliḥ˺, “Bring us what you threaten us with, if you are ˹truly˺ one of the messengers.”

77
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,980
Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them, and they fell lifeless in their homes.

78
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:13,820
So he turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Surely I conveyed to you my Lord’s message and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice, but you do not like ˹sincere˺ advisors.”

79
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:25,480
And ˹remember˺ when Lot scolded ˹the men of˺ his people, ˹saying,˺ “Do you commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before?

80
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:43,420
You lust after men instead of women! You are certainly transgressors.”

81
00:26:45,640 --> 00:27:00,660
But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel them from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!”

82
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:11,840
So We saved him and his family except his wife, who was one of the doomed.

83
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:20,100
We poured upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. See what was the end of the wicked!

84
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:57,440
And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has already come to you from your Lord. So give just measure and weight, do not defraud people of their property, nor spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. This is for your own good, if you are ˹truly˺ believers.

85
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:18,720
And do not lie in ambush on every road—threatening and hindering those who believe in Allah from His Path and striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. And consider the fate of the corruptors!

86
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:40,620
If some of you do believe in what I have been sent with while others do not, then be patient until Allah judges between us. He is the Best of Judges.”

87
00:28:40,620 --> 00:29:04,980
The arrogant chiefs of his people threatened, “O Shu’aib! We will certainly expel you and your fellow believers from our land, unless you return to our faith.” He replied, “Even if we hate it?

88
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:36,960
We would surely be fabricating a lie against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. It does not befit us to return to it unless it is the Will of Allah, our Lord. Our Lord has encompassed everything in ˹His˺ knowledge. In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of those who judge.”

89
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:46,600
The disbelieving chiefs of his people threatened, “If you follow Shu’aib, you will surely be losers!”

90
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,580
Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.

91
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:10,880
Those who rejected Shu’aib were ˹wiped out˺ as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected Shu’aib were the true losers.

92
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:29,660
He turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to disbelieve?”

93
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:45,940
Whenever We sent a prophet to a society, We afflicted its ˹disbelieving˺ people with suffering and adversity, so perhaps they would be humbled.

94
00:30:48,160 --> 00:31:07,600
Then We changed their adversity to prosperity until they flourished and argued ˹falsely˺, “Our forefathers ˹too˺ had been visited by adversity and prosperity.” So We seized them by surprise, while they were unaware.

95
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:29,120
Had the people of those societies been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, We would have overwhelmed them with blessings from heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they used to commit.

96
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:41,200
Did the people of those societies feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by night while they were asleep?

97
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:50,900
Or did they feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by day while they were at play?

98
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,140
Is it not clear to those who take over the land after ˹the destruction of˺ its former residents that—if We will—We can punish them ˹too˺ for their sins and seal their hearts so they will not hear ˹the truth˺?

99
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,520
We have narrated to you ˹O Prophet˺ some of the stories of those societies. Surely, their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but still they would not believe in what they had already denied. This is how Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.

100
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:51,060
We did not find most of them true to their covenant. Rather, We found most of them truly rebellious.

101
00:32:51,060 --> 00:33:07,860
Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See what was the end of the corruptors!

102
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:15,780
And Moses said, “O Pharaoh! I am truly a messenger from the Lord of all worlds,

103
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:31,920
obliged to say nothing about Allah except the truth. Indeed, I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the children of Israel go with me.”

104
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:42,300
Pharaoh said, “If you have come with a sign, then bring it if what you say is true.”

105
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:54,320
So Moses threw down his staff and—behold!—it became a real snake.

106
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,600
Then he drew his hand ˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for all to see.

107
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,600
The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, “He is indeed a skilled magician,

108
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:25,140
who seeks to drive you from your land.” ˹So Pharaoh asked,˺ “What do you propose?”

109
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:33,160
They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and send mobilizers to all cities

110
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,960
to bring you every clever magician.”

111
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:50,200
The magicians came to Pharaoh, saying, “Shall we receive a ˹suitable˺ reward if we prevail?”

112
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:58,800
He replied, “Yes, and you will certainly be among those closest to me.”

113
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:07,180
They asked, “O Moses! Will you cast, or shall we be the first to cast?”

114
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:20,960
Moses said, “You first.” So when they did, they deceived the eyes of the people, stunned them, and made a great display of magic.

115
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:35,160
Then We inspired Moses, “Throw down your staff,” and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion!

116
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,740
So the truth prevailed and their illusions failed.

117
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,560
So Pharaoh and his people were defeated right there and put to shame.

118
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,960
And the magicians fell down, prostrating.

119
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,420
They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—

120
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,380
the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”

121
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:12,840
Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? This must be a conspiracy you devised in the city to drive out its people, but soon you will see.

122
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:23,100
I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”

123
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,440
They responded, “Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.

124
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:45,060
Your rage towards us is only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, and let us die while submitting ˹to You˺.” 

125
00:36:45,060 --> 00:37:06,980
The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people protested, “Are you going to leave Moses and his people free to spread corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?” He responded, “We will kill their sons and keep their women. We will completely dominate them.”

126
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:36,020
Moses reassured his people, “Seek Allah’s help and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah ˹alone˺. He grants it to whoever He chooses of His servants. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.”

127
00:37:36,020 --> 00:38:00,300
They complained, “We have always been oppressed—before and after you came to us ˹with the message˺.” He replied, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land to see what you will do.”

128
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:11,520
Indeed, We afflicted Pharaoh’s people with famine and shortage of crops so they might come back ˹to their senses˺.

129
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:36,100
In times of prosperity, they said, “This is what we deserve,” but in adversity, they blamed it on Moses and those with him. Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of them did not know.

130
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:46,120
They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to deceive us, we will never believe in you.”

131
00:38:46,120 --> 00:39:01,180
So We plagued them with floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood—all as clear signs, but they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people.

132
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:23,160
When tormented, they pleaded, “O Moses! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If you help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you.”

133
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:31,200
But as soon as We removed the torment from them—until they met their inevitable fate—they broke their promise.

134
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:48,620
So We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them in the sea for denying Our signs and being heedless of them.

135
00:39:48,620 --> 00:40:17,400
And ˹so˺ We made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands, which We had showered with blessings. ˹In this way˺ the noble Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they established.

136
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:39,660
We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols. They demanded, “O Moses! Make for us a god like their gods.” He replied, “Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly!

137
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:51,400
What they follow is certainly doomed to destruction and their deeds are in vain.”

138
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:59,040
He added, “Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has honoured you above the others?”

139
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:28,280
And ˹remember˺ when We rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—killing your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.

140
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:49,980
We appointed for Moses thirty nights then added another ten—completing his Lord’s term of forty nights. Moses commanded his brother Aaron, “Take my place among my people, do what is right, and do not follow the way of the corruptors.”

141
00:41:49,980 --> 00:42:46,780
When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.”

142
00:42:46,780 --> 00:43:02,240
Allah said, “O Moses! I have ˹already˺ elevated you above all others by My messages and speech. So hold firmly to what I have given you and be grateful.”

143
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:23,120
We wrote for him on the Tablets ˹the fundamentals˺ of everything; commandments and explanations of all things. ˹We commanded,˺ “Hold to this firmly and ask your people to take the best of it. I will soon show ˹all of˺ you the home of the rebellious.

144
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:53,560
I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.

145
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:12,560
The deeds of those who deny Our signs and the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter will be in vain. Will they be rewarded except for what they have done?”

146
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:33,260
In the absence of Moses, his people made from their ˹golden˺ jewellery an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Path? Still they took it as a god and were wrongdoers.

147
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:58,260
Later, when they were filled with remorse and realized they had gone astray, they cried, “If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be losers.”

148
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:37,140
Upon Moses’ return to his people, ˹totally˺ furious and sorrowful, he said, “What an evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your Lord’s torment?” Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not ˹humiliate me and˺ make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing people.”

149
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:47,640
Moses prayed, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us into Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”

150
00:45:47,640 --> 00:46:01,300
Those who worshipped the calf will certainly be afflicted with Allah’s wrath as well as disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We reward those who invent falsehood.

151
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:15,060
But those who commit evil, then repent and become ˹true˺ believers, your Lord will certainly be All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.

152
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:34,600
When Moses’ anger subsided, he took up the Tablets whose text contained guidance and mercy for those who stand in awe of their Lord.

153
00:46:34,600 --> 00:47:29,360
Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment and, when they were seized by an earthquake, he cried, “My Lord! Had You willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test from You—by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide whoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best forgiver.

154
00:47:30,240 --> 00:48:17,460
Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You ˹in repentance˺.” Allah replied, “I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations.

155
00:48:17,460 --> 00:49:08,720
“˹They are˺ the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel. He commands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them what is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from their burdens and the shackles that bound them. ˹Only˺ those who believe in him, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be successful.”

156
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:51,760
Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am Allah’s Messenger to you all. To Him ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.

157
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:09,060
There are some among the people of Moses who guide with the truth and establish justice accordingly.

158
00:50:21,420 --> 00:51:00,760
We divided them into twelve tribes—each as a community. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out. Each tribe knew its drinking place. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails, ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” They ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.

159
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:21,140
And ˹remember˺ when it was said to them, “Enter this city ˹of Jerusalem˺ and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, ˹and˺ We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.”

160
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:36,860
But the wrongdoers among them changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their wrongdoing.

161
00:51:36,860 --> 00:52:00,180
Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath. During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.

162
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:19,600
When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”

163
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:36,980
When they ignored the warning they were given, We rescued those who used to warn against evil and overtook the wrongdoers with a dreadful punishment for their rebelliousness.

164
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:47,360
But when they stubbornly persisted in violation, We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!” 

165
00:52:47,360 --> 00:53:13,180
And ˹remember, O  Prophet,˺ when your Lord declared that He would send against them others who would make them suffer terribly until the Day of Judgment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

166
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:26,580
We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.

167
00:53:26,580 --> 00:54:03,960
Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?

168
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:13,800
As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously.

169
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:32,620
And ˹remember˺ when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a cloud and they thought it would fall on them. ˹We said,˺ “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.”

170
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:56,460
And ˹remember˺ when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. ˹Allah asked,˺ “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You are! We testify.” ˹He cautioned,˺ “Now you have no right to say on Judgment Day, ‘We were not aware of this.’

171
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:15,220
Nor say, ‘It was our forefathers who had associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺ and we, as their descendants, followed in their footsteps. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood they invented?’”

172
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,920
This is how We make our signs clear, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺.

173
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:54,220
And relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he became a deviant.

174
00:55:54,220 --> 00:56:21,300
If We had willed, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to this life—following his evil desires. His example is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it ˹still˺ pants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs. So narrate ˹to them˺ stories ˹of the past˺, so perhaps they will reflect.

175
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:34,480
What an evil example of those who denied Our signs! They ˹only˺ wronged their own souls.

176
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:46,960
Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, they are the ˹true˺ losers.

177
00:56:46,960 --> 00:57:22,220
Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless.

178
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:36,840
Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names. They will be punished for what they used to do.

179
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,600
And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and establishes justice accordingly.

180
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:51,240
As for those who deny Our signs, We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend.

181
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,940
I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless.

182
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:05,340
Have they not ever given it a thought? Their fellow man is not insane. He is only sent with a clear warning.

183
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:21,740
Have they ever reflected on the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything Allah has created, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in?

184
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:37,160
Whoever Allah allows to stray, none can guide, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.

185
00:58:37,160 --> 00:59:12,080
They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” Say, “That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will reveal it when the time comes. It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only take you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”

186
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:41,360
Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.”

187
00:59:41,360 --> 01:00:12,680
He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.”

188
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:24,660
But when He granted their descendants good offspring, they associated false gods in what He has given them. Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!

189
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:30,780
Do they associate ˹with Allah˺ those ˹idols˺ which cannot create anything, but are in fact created;

190
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:37,320
which cannot help them, or even help themselves?

191
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:50,040
And if you ˹idolaters˺ call upon them for guidance, they cannot respond to you. It is all the same whether you call them or remain silent.

192
01:00:50,040 --> 01:01:05,120
Those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah are created beings like yourselves. So call upon them and see if they will answer you, if your claims are true!

193
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:28,080
Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon your associate-gods and conspire against me without delay!

194
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:38,440
“Indeed, my Protector is Allah Who has revealed this Book. For He ˹alone˺ protects the righteous.

195
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:50,080
But those ˹false gods˺ you call besides Him can neither help you nor even themselves.”

196
01:01:50,080 --> 01:02:15,220
If you ˹idolaters˺ call them to guidance, they cannot hear. And you ˹O Prophet˺ may see them facing towards you, but they cannot see.

197
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:23,220
Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act ignorantly.

198
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:36,280
If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

199
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:50,720
Indeed, when Satan whispers to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, they remember ˹their Lord˺ then they start to see ˹things˺ clearly.

200
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,280
But the devils persistently plunge their ˹human˺ associates deeper into wickedness, sparing no effort.

201
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:23,060
If you ˹O Prophet˺ do not bring them a sign ˹which they demanded˺, they ask, “Why do you not make it yourself?” Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This ˹Quran˺ is an insight from your Lord—a guide and a mercy for those who believe.”

202
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:33,900
When the Quran is recited, listen to it attentively and be silent, so you may be shown mercy.

203
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:51,480
Remember your Lord inwardly with humility and reverence and in a moderate tone of voice, both morning and evening. And do not be one of the heedless.

204
01:03:54,260 --> 01:04:12,740
Surely those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate.
