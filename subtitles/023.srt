1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,220
Successful indeed are the believers:

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,860
those who humble themselves in prayer;

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,640
those who avoid idle talk;

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,780
those who pay alms-tax;

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,940
those who guard their chastity

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:37,100
except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, for then they are free from blame,

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:45,460
but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors;

8
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,100
˹the believers are also˺ those who are true to their trusts and covenants;

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,700
and those who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,880
These are the ones who will be awarded

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,660
Paradise as their own. They will be there forever.

12
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:17,980
And indeed, We created humankind from an extract of clay,

13
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:25,060
then placed each ˹human˺ as a sperm-drop in a secure place,

14
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:48,280
then We developed the drop into a clinging clot ˹of blood˺, then developed the clot into a lump ˹of flesh˺, then developed the lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, then We brought it into being as a new creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.

15
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,020
After that you will surely die,

16
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,200
then on the Day of Judgment you will be resurrected.

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:12,240
And indeed, We created above you seven levels ˹of heaven˺. We are never unmindful of ˹Our˺ creation.

18
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:30,460
We send down rain from the sky in perfect measure, causing it to soak into the earth. And We are surely able to take it away.

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:47,620
With it We produce for you gardens of palm trees and grapevines, in which there are abundant fruits, and from which you may eat,

20
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:59,160
as well as ˹olive˺ trees which grow at Mount Sinai, providing oil and a condiment to eat.

21
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:16,460
And there is certainly a lesson for you in cattle, from whose bellies We give you ˹milk˺ to drink, and in them are many other benefits for you, and from them you may eat.

22
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:23,840
And you are carried upon ˹some of˺ them and upon ships.

23
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:36,700
Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He declared, “O my people! Worship Allah ˹alone˺. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?”

24
00:03:36,700 --> 00:04:10,460
But the disbelieving chiefs of his people said ˹to the masses˺, “This is only a human like you, who wants to be superior to you. Had Allah willed, He could have easily sent down angels ˹instead˺. We have never heard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers.

25
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:19,760
He is simply insane, so bear with him for a while.” 

26
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,960
Noah prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied ˹me˺.”

27
00:04:26,820 --> 00:05:10,140
So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under Our ˹watchful˺ Eyes and directions. Then when Our command comes and the oven bursts ˹with water˺, take on board a pair from every species along with your family—except those against whom the decree ˹to drown˺ has already been passed. And do not plead with Me for those who have done wrong, for they will surely be drowned.”

28
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:27,640
Then when you and those with you have settled in the Ark, say, “All praise is for Allah, Who saved us from the wrongdoing people.”

29
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:38,040
And pray, “My Lord! Allow me a blessed landing, for You are the best accommodator.”

30
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:46,280
Surely in this are lessons. And We ˹always˺ put ˹people˺ to the test.

31
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,720
Then We raised another generation after them,

32
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:05,740
and sent to them a messenger from among themselves, ˹declaring,˺ “Worship Allah ˹alone˺. You have no god other than Him. Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?”

33
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:31,660
But the chiefs of his people—who disbelieved, denied the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter, and were spoiled by the worldly luxuries We had provided for them—said ˹to the masses˺, “This is only a human like you. He eats what you eat, and drinks what you drink.

34
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:39,860
And if you ˹ever˺ obey a human like yourselves, then you would certainly be losers.

35
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:50,500
Does he promise you that once you are dead and reduced to dust and bones, you will be brought forth ˹alive˺?

36
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,360
Impossible, simply impossible is what you are promised!

37
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:03,640
There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die, others are born, and none will be resurrected.

38
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:11,900
He is no more than a man who has fabricated a lie about Allah, and we will never believe in him.”

39
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,060
The messenger prayed, “My Lord! Help me, because they have denied ˹me˺.”

40
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,520
Allah responded, “Soon they will be truly regretful.”

41
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:34,500
Then the ˹mighty˺ blast overtook them with justice, and We reduced them to rubble. So away with the wrongdoing people!

42
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:43,200
Then We raised other generations after them.

43
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,600
No people can advance their doom, nor can they delay it.

44
00:07:49,600 --> 00:08:12,480
Then We sent Our messengers in succession: whenever a messenger came to his people, they denied him. So We destroyed them, one after the other, reducing them to ˹cautionary˺ tales. So away with the people who refuse to believe!

45
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:22,520
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and compelling proof

46
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,760
to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they behaved arrogantly and were a tyrannical people.

47
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:38,480
They argued, “Will we believe in two humans, like ourselves, whose people are slaves to us?”

48
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,080
So they rejected them both, and ˹so˺ were among those destroyed.

49
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,780
And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so perhaps his people would be ˹rightly˺ guided.

50
00:08:49,780 --> 00:09:08,580
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them refuge on high ground—a ˹suitable˺ place for rest with flowing water.

51
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:20,640
O messengers! Eat from what is good and lawful, and act righteously. Indeed, I fully know what you do.

52
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:31,680
Surely this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so fear Me ˹alone˺.

53
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:43,520
Yet the people have divided it into different sects, each rejoicing in what they have.

54
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,360
So leave them ˹O Prophet˺ in their heedlessness for a while.

55
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:56,840
Do they think, since We provide them with wealth and children,

56
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,880
that We hasten to ˹honour˺ them ˹with˺ all kinds of good? No! They are not aware.

57
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:09,120
Surely those who tremble in awe of their Lord,

58
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,840
and who believe in the revelations of their Lord,

59
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,160
and who associate none with their Lord,

60
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:32,960
and who do whatever ˹good˺ they do with their hearts fearful, ˹knowing˺ that they will return to their Lord—

61
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,100
it is they who race to do good deeds, always taking the lead.

62
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:54,560
We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. And with Us is a record which speaks the truth. None will be wronged.

63
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:06,820
But the hearts of those ˹who disbelieve˺ are oblivious to ˹all of˺ this, and they have other ˹evil˺ deeds, opposite to this, in which they are engrossed.

64
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:17,800
But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to cry for help.

65
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,660
˹They will be told,˺ “Do not cry for help today. Surely you will never be saved from Us.

66
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:36,400
Indeed, My revelations were recited to you, but you used to back away ˹in disgust˺,

67
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,160
boasting of the Sacred House, and babbling ˹nonsense about the Quran˺ by night.”

68
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:52,500
Is it because they have never contemplated the Word ˹of Allah˺? Or ˹because˺ there has come to them something that did not come to their forefathers?

69
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,600
Or ˹because˺ they failed to recognize their Messenger, and so they denied him?

70
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:10,440
Or ˹because˺ they say, “He is insane?” In fact, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are resentful of the truth.

71
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:28,660
Had the truth followed their desires, the heavens, the earth, and all those in them would have certainly been corrupted. In fact, We have brought them ˹the means to˺ their glory, but they turn away from it.

72
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:37,700
Or ˹is it because˺ you ˹O Prophet˺ are asking them for tribute? But the reward of your Lord is best, for He is the Best Provider.

73
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:44,320
And surely you are calling them to the Straight Path,

74
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,120
but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are certainly deviating from that Path.

75
00:12:52,120 --> 00:13:02,260
˹Even˺ if We had mercy on them and removed their affliction, they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.

76
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:11,280
And We have already seized them with torment, but they never humbled themselves to their Lord, nor did they ˹submissively˺ appeal ˹to Him˺.

77
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:24,160
But as soon as We open for them a gate of severe punishment, they will be utterly desperate.

78
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:35,060
He is the One Who created for you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.

79
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,520
And He is the One Who has dispersed you ˹all˺ over the earth, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be gathered.

80
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:51,980
And He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and to Him belongs the alternation of the day and night. Will you not then understand?

81
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,740
But they ˹just˺ say what their predecessors said.

82
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:08,080
They said, “Once we are dead and reduced to dust and bones, will we really be resurrected?

83
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:24,280
We have already been promised this, as well as our forefathers earlier. This is nothing but ancient fables!”

84
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:33,680
Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “To whom belong the earth and all those on it, if you ˹really˺ know?”

85
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,100
They will reply, “To Allah!” Say, “Why are you not then mindful?”

86
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:46,940
˹And˺ ask ˹them˺, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne?”

87
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,440
They will reply, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?”

88
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:05,940
Ask ˹them also,˺ “In Whose Hands is the authority over all things, protecting ˹all˺ while none can protect against Him, if you ˹really˺ know?”

89
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:13,620
They will reply, “Allah.” Say, “How are you then so deluded?”

90
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,420
In fact, We have brought them the truth, and they are certainly liars.

91
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:39,440
Allah has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they would have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is Allah above what they claim!

92
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:46,360
˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and unseen. Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺.

93
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,500
Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Should You show me what they are threatened with,

94
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,440
then, my Lord, do not count me among the wrongdoing people.”

95
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,260
We are indeed able to show you what We have threatened them with.

96
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,840
Respond to evil with what is best. We know well what they claim.

97
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:20,220
And say, “My Lord! I seek refuge in You from the temptations of the devils.

98
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,900
And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, that they ˹even˺ come near me.”

99
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:36,900
When death approaches any of them, they cry, “My Lord! Let me go back,

100
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:59,900
so I may do good in what I left behind.” Never! It is only a ˹useless˺ appeal they make. And there is a barrier behind them until the Day they are resurrected. 

101
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:19,800
Then, when the Trumpet will be blown, there will be no kinship between them on that Day, nor will they ˹even care to˺ ask about one another. 

102
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:28,780
As for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, it is they who will be successful.

103
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:47,720
But those whose scale is light, they will have doomed themselves, staying in Hell forever.

104
00:17:47,720 --> 00:18:02,360
The Fire will burn their faces, leaving them deformed.

105
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:11,720
˹It will be said,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you, but you used to deny them?”

106
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:28,720
They will cry, “Our Lord! Our ill-fate took hold of us, so we became a misguided people.

107
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:43,100
Our Lord! Take us out of this ˹Fire˺. Then if we ever return ˹to denial˺, we will truly be wrongdoers.”

108
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,180
Allah will respond, “Be despised in there! Do not ˹ever˺ plead with Me ˹again˺!

109
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:13,360
Indeed, there was a group of My servants who used to pray, ‘Our Lord! We have believed, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of those who show mercy,’

110
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:26,320
but you were ˹so busy˺ making fun of them that it made you forget My remembrance. And you used to laugh at them.

111
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:36,280
Today I have indeed rewarded them for their perseverance: they are certainly the triumphant.”

112
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,180
He will ask ˹them˺, “How many years did you remain on earth?”

113
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:47,120
They will reply, “We remained ˹only˺ a day or part of a day. But ask those who kept count.”

114
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:59,040
He will say, “You only remained for a little while, if only you knew.

115
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:15,260
Did you then think that We had created you without purpose, and that you would never be returned to Us?”

116
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:28,160
Exalted is Allah, the True King! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the Honourable Throne.

117
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Whoever invokes, besides Allah, another god—for which they can have no proof—they will surely find their penalty with their Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will never succeed.

118
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:53,860
Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the best of those who show mercy.”
