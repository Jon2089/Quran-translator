1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,320
What are they asking one another about?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
About the momentous news,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,820
over which they disagree.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,460
But no! They will come to know.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,740
Again, no! They will come to know.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,620
Have We not smoothed out the earth ˹like a bed˺,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,580
and ˹made˺ the mountains as ˹its˺ pegs,

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,180
and created you in pairs,

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,900
and made your sleep for rest,

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,160
and made the night as a cover,

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,640
and made the day for livelihood,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,900
and built above you seven mighty ˹heavens˺,

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,280
and placed ˹in them˺ a shining lamp,

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,100
and sent down from rainclouds pouring water,

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,580
producing by it grain and ˹various˺ plants,

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,980
and dense orchards?

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,420
Indeed, the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision is an appointed time—

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:11,340
˹it is˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and you will ˹all˺ come forth in crowds.

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:21,760
The sky will be ˹split˺ open, becoming ˹many˺ gates,

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,620
and the mountains will be blown away, becoming ˹like˺ a mirage.

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,420
Indeed, Hell is lying in ambush

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,640
as a home for the transgressors,

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:49,120
where they will remain for ˹endless˺ ages.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:59,820
There they will not taste any coolness or drink,

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,700
except boiling water and ˹oozing˺ pus—

26
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,880
a fitting reward.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,140
For they never expected any reckoning,

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,360
and totally rejected Our signs.

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,640
And We have everything recorded precisely.

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,140
˹So the deniers will be told,˺ “Taste ˹the punishment˺, for all you will get from Us is more torment.”

31
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,540
Indeed, the righteous will have salvation—

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,140
Gardens, vineyards,

33
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
and full-bosomed maidens of equal age,

34
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,240
and full cups ˹of pure wine˺,

35
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,480
never to hear any idle talk or lying therein—

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,560
a ˹fitting˺ reward as a generous gift from your Lord,

37
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:09,160
the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, the Most Compassionate. No one will dare speak to Him

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:38,460
on the Day the ˹holy˺ spirit and the angels will stand in ranks. None will talk, except those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are true.

39
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:56,540
That Day is the ˹ultimate˺ truth. So let whoever wills take the path leading back to their Lord.

40
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:27,600
Indeed, We have warned you of an imminent punishment—the Day every person will see ˹the consequences of˺ what their hands have done, and the disbelievers will cry, “I wish I were dust.”
