1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,440
the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,100
Master of the Day of Judgment.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,040
You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,960
Guide us along the Straight Path,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:32,160
the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.
